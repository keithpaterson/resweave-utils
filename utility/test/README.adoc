= Test package

This package contains utilities that are intended to be used with unit tests.
They contain calls to ginkgo/gomega functions that won't be available in release builds.

To enable this code you must include `-tags testutils` at build time.

== HTTP Service

Implements a fake HTTP service that allows the tester to control how the service response to incoming requests.

This is excellent for testing code that uses the xref:../../client/README.adoc[http client]

This test service uses a Fluent-like interface for declaring how the client is going to behave, which enhances
readability of your tests and provides a consistent mechanism for exercising your http request/response testing.

The test.HttpService will allow you respond with any status code and embed service errors or other data into the
response so that you can test how your resource handler is dealing with good/bad responses.

Keep in mind that this is intended to exercise the client side; using this will not evaluate the actual service
logic; for that you will want to write integration tests that won't use this class.

For example:

Assume you have a FooClient that emits a Get request to fetch a specific `Foo` based on an ID.
[source,go]
----
func (fr *FooClient) Fetch(_ context.Context, id int) (FooResponse, error) {
    req := request.NewGetRequest(fr.host + "/foo/" + id)
    httpClient := client.DefaultHTTPClient() // more likely this is a member but for clarity here it is.
    resp, err := httpClient.Execute(req)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var respFoo FooResponse
    err = response.ParseResponseJsonData(resp, http.StatusOK, &respFoo)
    return respFoo, err
}
----

Your test code for the success case might look something like this:
[source,go]
----
var _ = Describe("Test Foo Resource", func() {
    It("should return a FooResponse in the success case", func() {
        foo := Foo{ID: 123, Name: "My Foo"}
        fooResp  := FooResponse{ID: 123, Name: "My Foo", Status: "active"}
        svc := test.HttpService().
            WithMethod(http.MethodGet).
            WithPath("/foo/123").
            WithJsonBody(foo).
            ReturnStatusCode(http.StatusOK).
            ReturnJsonBody(fooResp)
        host, tearDown := svc.Start()
        defer tearDown()

        // Note that you'll need to be able to tell the FooResource class what the host name is, because
        // the test service may use a different port for each test (so tests can run concurrently)
        fooClient := &FooClient{host: host, ...} // whatever init is required for the client object
        resFoo, err := fooResource.Fetch(context.TODO(), 123)

        Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred())
        Expect(resFoo).To(Equal(&fooResp))
    })
})
----

== JSON utilities

=== MustMarshalJson()

Used during testing to ensure that JSON data is marshalled into a byte slice.
If the JSON data cannot be marshalled the test will Fail immediately.

This is useful if you are reading test data from a file or you want to inject JSON data into an object
like the test HTTP client as an inline call.

This could also be used to do a raw byte comparison of a JSON response against an expected value to ensure
that the stream/body data is exactly what you expect it to be. 

For Example:

_(This is a bit contrived; `WithJsonBody(foo)` is more appropriate here, but it illustrates proper usage.)_
[source,go]
----

foo := Foo{ID: 123, Name: "My Foo"}
fooResp  := FooResponse{ID: 123, Name: "My Foo", Status: "active"}
svc := test.HttpService().
    WithMethod(http.MethodGet).
    WithPath("/foo/123").
    WithBody(test.MustMarshalJson(foo)). // equivalent to using `WithJsonBody(foo).`
    ReturnStatusCode(http.StatusOK).
    ReturnJsonBody(fooResp)
----
