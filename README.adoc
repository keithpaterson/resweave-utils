== Importing

To import this project you need this command-line:
```
go get github.com/keithpaterson/resweave-utils
```

=== Dependencies

To run the `pkg` script you will need access to the `bash_tools` repository:

Normally the `pkg` sctipt will automatically download and use it, but you can download it for
your personal use and point the `pkg` script to it:

* (clone this to some locally convenient folder)
```
git clone git@github.com:keithpaterson/bash_tools.git
```

* You will need to set an environment variable to point at the `bash_tools` folder:
```
export BASH_TOOLS_DIR="path/to/bash_tools"
```

== Tests

To run unit tests you need to include the 'testutils' build tag; the `pkg`` script does that for you.
