= Resweave Utilities
Helpers for easier resource management and other utilities

== Importing

To import this project you need this command-line:
```
GOPRIVATE=github.com/keithpaterson/resweave-utils go get github.com/keithpaterson/resweave-utils
```

=== dependencies

To run the build.sh script you will need `bash_tools`:
(clone this to some locally convenient folder)
```
git clone git@github.com:keithpaterson/bash_tools.git
```

You will need to set an environment variable to point at the `bash_tools` folder:
```
export BASH_TOOLS_DIR="path/to/bash_tools"
```

== Tests

To run unit tests you need to include the 'testutils' build tag; the build.sh script does that for you.
